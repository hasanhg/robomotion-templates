# Calculator
Read operations from an excel file, makes calculations using calculator and writes the results to the same file.

2. Set the msg.calc_path field to the relative path of calculator process according to
your PATH envrionment variable.

3. Set the msg.excel_path field to the full filepath of the excel file including
calculation operations.

# Run Process
Runs an executable file which is (curl), and shows the standart output of the process (which is IP address of the user ) in message box

## How it Works?
1. Edit Config (Function) node

2. If you do not have curl, you should download from [here](https://curl.se/download.html)

3. Update msg.executable_path field with the path of the executable file you downloaded.
```js
msg.executable_path = "C:\\Windows\\System32\\curl.exe";
```

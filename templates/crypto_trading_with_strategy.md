# Crypto Trading With Strategy
This template fetches historical data from **Binance**, creates EMA5 and EMA100 indicators and creates a strategy with Robomotion's library. Finally plots them with decision labels

## How it Works?

1. Edit the Config Node

2. Update the currency pair with you want

3. Update the root path 

4. Set your operating system

5. Set the start date which the starting point of the historical data

6. Set the end date which the end point of the historical data. If it is empty, the end date becomes current date

7. Create Binance API and Secret keys, put them to your vault as API Key/ Token Type. Finaly select them in the **Connect** node

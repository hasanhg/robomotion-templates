# State Machine Example
Simulates a basic Finite State Machine example. It is inspired by a vending machine, where you can put some
coins in and get some items out.

## How it Works?
1. Edit the Config Node

2. Set the msg.coin field to the amount of extra coins you want to get at the beginning. (Optional)
